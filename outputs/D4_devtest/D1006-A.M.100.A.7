Seven weeks before Merck& Co. pulled the arthritis drug Vioxx off the market because of safety concerns, federal drug regulators downplayed the significance of scientific findings citing the increased risks, documents released Thursday show.

Dr David Graham, associate director for science in the drug safety division of the Food and Drug Administration presented Graham's findings Aug. 25, but already had encountered the resistance from supervisors.
The Food and Drug Administration silenced one of its drug experts who raised safety concerns weeks before Merck& Co. yanked the blockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack and strokes, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said Thursday.
