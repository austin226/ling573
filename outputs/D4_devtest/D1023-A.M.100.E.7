Wednesday, Feb. 24, 1999 More Avalanches in Austria LANDECK, Austria AP -- Another killer avalanche brought new heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
Austrian soldiers took advantage of a break in heavy snowfall today to mount a rescue of avalanche victims from a stricken Alpine town, joining villagers who dug with their bare hands in a frantic effort to reach those buried below.
Congress should just let the independent counsel law expire since almost any effort to revise it so soon after President Clinton's impeachment acquittal is likely to be a mistake, former White House chief of staff Howard Baker told a Senate committee today.
An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.
