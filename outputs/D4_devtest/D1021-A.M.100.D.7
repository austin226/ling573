A hitch has developed in a plea deal agreed to by a former teacher who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.
A female teacher pleaded guilty Tuesday's to having sex with a 14-year-old student, avoiding prison as part of a plea agreement.
A female teacher whose sexual liaisons with a 14-year-old middle school student made tabloid headlines has avoided prison time by pleading guilty to having sex with the boy in a classroom and at Owen Lafave home.
Now that both sides have admitted a crush of worldwide media attention helped former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave land a plea deal that avoided prison time for seducing a 14-year-old boy, two questions remain Was the constant media coverage, which eventually convinced the victim's family to go along with the plea deal, part of the defense's strategy all along?
To try to use media interest to make it more difficult for the victim's family to go through this process made sense from a tactical standpoint, said Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore, noting that former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave attended many hearings in the entire case, ensuring cameras would capture her every move. But I do n't think even former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons could anticipate all of the twists and turns and intensity of the constant media coverage, which eventually convinced the victim's family to go along with the plea deal, part of the defense's strategy all along. Fitzgibbons declined to comment directly on how the media might have impacted the victim's family.
