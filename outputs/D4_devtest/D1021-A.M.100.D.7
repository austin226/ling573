The boy's family pulled the plug on prosecution, agreeing Tuesday to a plea deal that will keep the former Greco Middle School teacher out of prison.
A female teacher whose sexual liaisons with a 14-year-old middle school student made tabloid headlines has avoided prison time by pleading guilty to having sex with the boy in a classroom and at Owen Lafave home.
The boy said he and Owen Lafave, a newlywed at the time, got to know each other on them way back from a class trip to SeaWorld Orlando in May 2004.
Now that both sides have admitted a crush of worldwide media attention helped former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave land a plea deal that avoided prison time for seducing a 14-year-old boy, two questions remain Was the constant media coverage, which eventually convinced the victim's family to go along with the plea deal, part of the defense's strategy all along?
A hitch has developed in a plea deal agreed to by a former teacher who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.
