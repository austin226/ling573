Vietnam is launching a support fund for the estimated 300,000 Agent Orange victims in Vietnam, more than two decades after its use by US forces in the Vietnam War, the Labor newspaper reported Saturday.
The paper quoted Nguyen Trong Nhan, chairman of the Vietnam Red Cross, as saying those affected by the toxic chemical will receive assistance from a support fund for victims of the defoliant Agent Orange, more than two decades after its use by US forces in the Vietnam War by the year 2000 after a survey on the estimated 300,000 Agent Orange victims in Vietnam is completed next year.
HANOI, the former South Vietnam AP -- The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of With Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
The symbolism was lost on the children, all born with birth defects that often are the result of contact by parents with dioxin, a toxic component of the war-era defoliant Agent Orange.
Benefits for Vietnam War veterans are not likely to be affected by an independent review that confirms ties of Agent Orange to several diseases without resolving lingering questions about birth defects or diabetes.
