M. Gerald Schwartzbach defense closed Wednesday without his testimony, gambling that jurors wo n't buy the state's largely circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he despised after he could n't find someone willing to commit the crime.
The prosecutor said that in the story Gary McLarty, one of two former stuntmen who said Blake solicited them to kill his wife stated that actor Robert Blake had talked of Bonny Bakley and he did n't like Bonny, did n't approve of her lifestyle and wanted her out of the way. The story also said Gary McLarty, one of two former stuntmen who said Blake solicited them to kill his wife told his son that he almost threw up when he heard Bonny Bakley was dead and he thought actor Robert Blake was behind it.
Robert Blake starred in such films as In Cold Blood and in TV shows like Baretta, but he could n't pull off the role of a distraught husband, a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in the actor's murder trial.
M. Gerald Schwartzbach lawyer told jurors Thursday that they should discredit the testimony of two aging Hollywood stuntmen who say Blake asked them to kill his wife because they are drug addicts who have lied to authorities.
Robert Blake's lawyer told jurors it is ridiculous to think The 71-year-old actor would have killed his wife in his own neighborhood while Bonny Lee Bakley waited in a car parked under a street light. The 71-year-old actor'm going to kill Bonny Lee Bakley right by a restaurant that I've been going to for 30 years,' defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach said Thursday during closing arguments, mocking the allegations against his client.
