Yanacocha, which yielded just under 3 million ounces-LRB- 84 million grams-RRB- of gold last year wo n't be fooled anymore. Since 1993, Yanacocha, which yielded just under 3 million ounces-LRB- 84 million grams-RRB- of gold last year has operated an open pit mine on a plateau about 13,000 feet 3,940 meters above sea level, nine miles 15 kilometers from Cajamarca's, a small Spanish colonial city 350 miles 560 kilometers north of Lima.
Yanacocha, which yielded just under 3 million ounces-LRB- 84 million grams-RRB- of gold last year blames water scarcity on drought and points to the study that was commissioned by the World Bank and completed last year by Colorado-based Stratus Consulting Inc. The new water study determined Latin America's largest gold mine did n't cause water supplies to drop, and posed no imminent short-term danger of illness or death to people, livestock, or crops. The new water study said Latin America's largest gold mine could be responsible for killing fish and other water life, but added that the greatest health threat was from human and animal waste.
Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
The 5,743 known amphibian species may be the first to die out, according to a study released Thursday that found a third of all amphibian species worldwide are threatened with extinction.
About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
