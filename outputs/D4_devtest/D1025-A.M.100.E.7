As the Bush administration prepares to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list, a schism has emerged in the environmental movement over whether the bears remain at risk.
If Yellowstone's do n't, we play right into the hands of the people who are trying to kill the Endangered Species Act by reforming it. A draft proposal to take Yellowstone's grizzlies off the endangered species list, a schism has emerged in the environmental movement over whether the bears remain at risk went out this summer from field offices of the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.
Grizzly bears in areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park would be removed from the endangered species list under a proposal to be announced next week, officials said.
Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the US Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Twenty-one grizzlies have been illegally killed here in northwest Montana in the past two years, a record pace for poaching since the great bears of Montana were listed 30 years ago as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
