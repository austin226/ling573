Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye, said a BBC report.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Britain's food safety watchdog Thursday added another 146 products to a list of items tainted by a potentially cancer-causing dye in the country's largest food recall yet.
The Food Standards Agency-LRB- FSA-RRB- has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products.
