Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
Britain's food safety watchdog ordered the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Britain's food watchdog said Thursday it has launched an unprecedented investigation into how an allegedly cancer-causing agent Sudan 1 find its way into the string of British food industry.
Determined to find out how traces of the illegal dye Sudan 1 found Britain's food watchdog into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was conducting its largest ever investigation with the help of five local authorities.
