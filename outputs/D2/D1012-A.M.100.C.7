High in the skies above the Aegean Sea, two Greek fighter pilots nudged their F-16s to either side of a Cypriot passenger jet and quickly discerned the disaster that was unfolding.
A Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by a private jetliner Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, with 115 passengers including 48 children and six crew members on board, Greek news media reported.
Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. 0920 GMT near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people on board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that rapidly starved the pilots of oxygen, aviation experts said.
The Greek government on Sunday ruled out the possibility of a terror attack after a Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by the private Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, killing all 115 passengers and six crew members on board.
