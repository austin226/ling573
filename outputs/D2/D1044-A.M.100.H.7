Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
Cyprus health services have advised people not to eat foods imported from Britain that have contaminated an illegal dye named Sudan I, local press reported Tuesday.
Sudan I, a potentially cancer- causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
Britain's food watchdog said Thursday it has launched an unprecedented investigation into how an allegedly cancer-causing agent Sudan 1 find its way into the string of British food industry.
Britain's food safety watchdog Thursday added another 146 products to a list of items tainted by a potentially cancer-causing dye in the country's largest food recall yet.
