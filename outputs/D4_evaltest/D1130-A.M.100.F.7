Indonesian navy ships on Monday renewed efforts to reach survivors of a ferry disaster who spent a third night on the open sea as continuing rough weather hindered the search for hundreds still missing.
Rescue ships collected scores of bloated corpses Monday from seas close to where an Indonesian ferry sank in the Java Sea, but search teams also spotted survivors on life rafts and dropped food and water to them, officials said.
Bloated bodies washed up along Indonesia's coastline days after a ferry sank in stormy weather leaving 400 people missing, but rescue teams refused to give up hope with survivors still being found in life-rafts, some desperately waving their arms.
Bad weather on Tuesday prevented search aircraft from looking for more survivors from an Indonesian ferry that sank in stormy weather as 400 people remained missing days after the disaster.
Indonesian navy ships Wednesday battled storms and gale force winds to rescue more than 200 survivors, with hundreds still missing five days after the ship sank in a storm off Java island. Warship KRI Hiu saved more than 200 survivors just south of Bawean island today Wednesday, Central Java navy commander Colonel Yan Simamora told AFP.
