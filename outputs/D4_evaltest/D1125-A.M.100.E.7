On Dec. 27, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne announced a proposal to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act because of the loss of its sea ice habitat from global warming.
Internal memos circulated in the Alaskan division of the US Fish and Wildlife Service appear to require government biologists or other employees traveling in countries around the Arctic not to discuss climate change, polar bears or sea ice if they are not designated to do so.
In December, the Bush administration, facing a deadline under a suit by environmental groups, proposed listing polar bears throughout the US Fish and Wildlife Service range as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because the warming climate is causing a summertime retreat of sea ice that the bears use as for seal hunting.
The federal agency responsible for protecting Arctic polar bears has barred two Alaska scientists from speaking about polar bears, climate change or sea ice at international meetings in the next few weeks, a move that environmentalists say is censorship The rule was issued last month by the US Fish and Wildlife Service but was made public this week.
The Bush administration will examine whether a growing number of species, including polar bears affected by thinning sea ice, are at risk from global warming and need federal protection, The Associated Press Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said Friday.
