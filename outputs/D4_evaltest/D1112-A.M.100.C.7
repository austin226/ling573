Relatives of Juan Manuel Alvarez's said Thursday that he was the product of a violent family that exposed him to incest, rape, substance abuse and drug trafficking over two generations.
Having recently won a murder conviction for the real Juan Alvarez in Glendale's 2005 Metrolink train disaster, prosecutors kicked off their arguments Monday trying to persuade jurors to sentence the Compton handyman to death.
Juan Alvarez apologized Tuesday for causing a commuter train disaster that killed 11 people, testifying that he was trying to kill himself and never meant to harm anyone else.
The man who caused the 2005 Metrolink train derailment that left 11 dead was violent and dangerous and considered killing people in the days leading up to the crash, Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan said Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.
Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan pounded Juan Manuel Alvarez for details about threats he admitted making to kill or injure his then-estranged wife, his cousin and others before he parked his SUV on railroad tracks in Glendale, causing the Jan. 26, 2005, collision.
