Pink coral, cedar trees, types of fish eaten in Europe and a cuddly, wide-eyed mammal that is prized in Asian medicine are among the animal and plant species that could gain greater protection this year, a UN agency said Wednesday.
The Caribbean's coral species essential to the region's reef ecosystems are at risk of extinction as a result of climate change, according to a new marine life study released Thursday.
The global wildlife trade watchdog agreed Wednesday's to regulate sales of red coral, which conservationists say is under threat from overfishing for the red coral industry.
The UN wildlife trade organisation back-tracked Friday and removed restrictions it had imposed days earlier on the global trade in coral species severely depleted by commercial exploitation.
But increasingly, divers and snorkelers are swimming over bleached hunks of coral devastated by shore runoff or overfishing.From the South Pacific to the Caribbean, coral reefs -- which are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems -- are bearing the brunt of climate change and other human-driven activities -- including coastal development, deforestation, and unrestricted tourism.
