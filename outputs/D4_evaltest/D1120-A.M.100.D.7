Global warming will worsen drought and reduce flows on the Colorado River, a key water source for several western states, according to a report released Wednesday.
Today The Colorado River Delta is a barren expanse of salt-stained mudflats where the river used to meet the sea south of Yuma, Ariz. About 90 percent of The Colorado River Delta wetlands and natural habitat dried up over the past half century, as water from the Colorado was captured in reservoirs and diverted to farms and cities from Las Vegas to Mexicali, Mexico's. For more than a decade, conservation groups in the US and Mexico's have tried unsuccessfully to restore North America's largest desert estuary.
Outside the the Bellagio casino, tourists stare at fountains thrusting water into the sky as Elvis sings Viva Las Vegas. Meanwhile, off the Strip, residents dig up their lawns to save water- and get paid for it.
Facing the worst drought in a century and the prospect that climate change could yield long-term changes on the Colorado River, the lifeline for several Western states, federal officials have reached a new pact with the states on how to allocate water if the river runs short.
The shortage guidelines, more than two years in the making, come in the eighth year of the worst drought in the century-long historic record of the Colorado, which supplies water to 25 million people and 1 million acres of farmland.
