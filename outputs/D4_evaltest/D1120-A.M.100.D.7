Outside the the Bellagio casino, tourists stare at fountains thrusting water into the sky as Elvis sings Viva Las Vegas. Meanwhile, off the Strip, residents dig up their lawns to save water- and get paid for it.
Global warming will worsen drought and reduce flows on the Colorado River, a key water source for several western states, according to a report released Wednesday.
Facing the worst drought in a century and the prospect that climate change could yield long-term changes on the Colorado River, the lifeline for several Western states, federal officials have reached a new pact with the states on how to allocate water if the river runs short.
State and federal officials praised the agreement, which Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was expected to sign Thursday, as a landmark akin to the Colorado River Compact of 1922 that first divvied up how much water the seven states served by the Colorado River -- California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming -- receive annually.
The shortage guidelines, more than two years in the making, come in the eighth year of the worst drought in the century-long historic record of the Colorado, which supplies water to 25 million people and 1 million acres of farmland.
