" the boy's mother could n't imagine sitting there and looking at Kristian Owen Lafave and then looking at Kristian Owen Lafave surrounded by the whole courtroom as well as looking at Kristian Owen Lafave talking about things that should n't have happened to Kristian Owen Lafave," the boy's mother said.
A female teacher whose sexual liaisons with a 14-year-old middle school student made tabloid headlines has avoided prison time by pleading guilty to having sex with the boy in a classroom and at Owen Lafave home.
" The victim's mother said the boy is" well-adjusted" and shows no signs of having been traumatized. the boy told investigators the boy and Owen Lafave had sex in a classroom at the school, located in Temple Terrace near Tampa, in Owen Lafave Riverview town house and once in a vehicle while the boy 15-year-old cousin drove them around. the boy said the boy and Owen Lafave, a newlywed at the time, got to know each other on them way back from a class trip to SeaWorld Orlando in May 2004. the boy also said Owen Lafave told the boy Owen Lafave marriage was in trouble and that Owen Lafave was aroused by the fact that having sex with the boy was not allowed.
Now that both sides have admitted a crush of worldwide media attention helped former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave land a plea deal that avoided prison time for seducing a 14-year-old boy, two questions remain.
A hitch has developed in a plea deal agreed to by a former teacher who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.
