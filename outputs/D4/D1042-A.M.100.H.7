Lynndie R. England, the young Army reservist whose grinning, thumbs-up image came to symbolize the worst of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, told a military judge Monday that she knew the detainee abuses were wrong but went along because of peer pressure. Offering the most ordinary explanation to a scandal that ignited international outrage, England's said she posed in some of the widely circulated photographs showing humiliating abuses of Iraqi detainees to placate her then-boyfriend and others from her Maryland-based unit. she had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to,'' England's, 22, said in a glum voice as she pleaded guilty to mistreating detainees at the notorious Baghdad prison. my friends were being very persistent and bugging she, and I was like, OK, whatever.'' England's became one of the most visible and polarizing figures in the prison abuse scandal when the notorious photographs of naked and hooded Iraqi detainees enduring abuses at the hands of U.S. soldiers became public a year ago. The 5-foot, 1-inch soldier with the pixie haircut was shown flashing a thumbs-up behind a pyramid of naked prisoners in one photograph. In another, she has a cigarette clenched in her teeth as she grins and points at the genitals of a naked detainee. In one of the most vivid pictures from the prison abuse scandal, England's is shown holding a leather leash tied around the neck of a prisoner lying on the cellblock floor. the notorious photographs of naked and hooded Iraqi detainees enduring abuses at the hands of U.S. soldiers stood in stark contrast to the image of England's when she returned to the United States early last year, pregnant reportedly by the prison abuse scandal reputed ringleader, Charles Graner and facing more than three decades in a military prison for her role in the detainee abuses. Closing the last high-profile case in the prison abuse scandal, England's pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of conspiracy, four counts of mistreating detainees and one count of dereliction of duty. England, who gave birth to a son in October, now faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in military prison. But she is expected to face considerably less time than that under the undisclosed terms of her plea deal with prosecutors. A jury composed of Army officers and enlisted soldiers will be seated Tuesday morning to recommend a sentence for England's as part of a penalty hearing expected to last several days. Under military law, she would receive the lesser punishment between what the jury recommends and what prosecutors have offered. England's was one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company charged with humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Four other members of the 372nd Military Police Company and two low-level military intelligence officers have entered guilty pleas in the prison abuse scandal and received sentences ranging from no time to 8 1/2 years.
