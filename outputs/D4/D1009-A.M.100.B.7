I do n't know what happened,'' her mother Patsy Ramsey said in a Channel 4 documentary, according to highlights published in The Times of London on Thursday.
Three former friends of the parents of John and Patsy Ramsey, parents of the slain child have asked for a special prosecutor to take over the stalled 20-month-old investigation into the slaying of JonBenet, the 6-year-old Colorado beauty princess.
Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter appointed Bruce Levin and Mitch Morrissey, in part, because of criticism he has mishandled the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case.
Given all the recent questions... public confidence demanded absolutely that we have the most experienced prosecutor we could get,'' said Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter.
