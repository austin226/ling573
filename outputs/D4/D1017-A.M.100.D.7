NASSAU, Bahamas AP -- Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the southeastern Bahamas on the huge storm's path.
WASHINGTON- Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, Federal Emergency Management Agency's says Federal Emergency Management Agency's wo n't be as tardy as Federal Emergency Management Agency's was after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
This could be the storm FEMA Director James Lee Witt has been dreading since taking office six years ago: a catastrophic hurricane that hugs the coastline from Florida to the Carolinas, causing massive damage along a swath hundreds of miles long.
The prospect of an extremely powerful, coast-hugging hurricane was a scenario that ever since the storm FEMA Director James Lee Witt've been here the storm FEMA Director James Lee Witt've hoped the storm FEMA Director James Lee Witt'd never see,'' the storm FEMA Director James Lee Witt said Monday, noting that the destruction could cover not just one area, the destruction's the whole coastline and the pounding the destruction's going to take.
A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive pounded toward Florida's Monday, forcing hundreds of thousands from hundreds of thousands homes and leaving countless residents to hope that the massive storm would somehow miss hundreds of thousands cities.
