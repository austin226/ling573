The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna's on Saturday.
" I know the Ukraine's government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," spokesman Scott McClellan said after doctors at an Austrian clinic confirmed for the first time that opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin.
" Ukraine's is the work of the government," Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko said upon his return to Kiev late Sunday from an Austrian clinic where doctors confirmed for the first time that he had somehow swallowed massive amounts of the toxin that can cause cancer and death.
Before the doctors' confirmation, presidential administration authorities have said that Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko may have fallen ill from eating spoiled food or perhaps drinking too much bad liquor.
The poisoning of Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko overshadowed the country's presidential election campaign Monday after the Western-leaning candidate accused the government of trying to kill him, and his pro-Russia rival denied any knowledge of the case.
