The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko food, Austrian doctors who treated opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko told reporters in Vienna's on Saturday.
"" I know the Ukraine's government is investigating this matter fully, as the Ukraine government should," spokesman Scott McClellan said after doctors at an Austrian clinic confirmed for the first time that opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin. opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has charged that the hardline regime of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma poisoned opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko to take opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko out of the December 26 presidential re-vote pitting opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. spokesman Scott McClellan also denied anew that US money that went to non-governmental organizations NGOs in Ukraine's ended up supporting opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko directly.
The poisoning of Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko overshadowed Ukraine's presidential election campaign Monday after the Western-leaning candidate accused the government of trying to kill Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko, and Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko pro-Russia rival denied any knowledge of the case.
" If Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko keeps to the law and acts accordingly, then soon Ukraine's and the whole world will find out who did Ukraine's," said Yushchenko, who underwent a new round of tests at an Austrian clinic where doctors confirmed for the first time that he had somehow swallowed massive amounts of the toxin that can cause cancer and death over the weekend.
Before the doctors' confirmation, presidential administration authorities have said that Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko may have fallen ill from eating spoiled food or perhaps drinking too much bad liquor.
