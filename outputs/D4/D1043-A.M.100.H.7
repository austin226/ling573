A previously unknown Islamic group on Monday claimed responsibility for an earlier killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri due to his ties with Saudi Arabia, the Qatar-based al-Jazeera TV channel reported.
The Lebanese interior minister said on Tuesday that initial indications showed that former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a suicide car bombing.
" The Lebanese people will be the protectors of the fairness of an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, especially if this case is dealt with the required transparency," Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said.
Wailing and shouting, hundreds of thousands of the mourners made their way in a somber but angry procession Wednesday from the home of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to his burial place in the grounds of an unfinished mosque that was one of his favorite reconstruction projects.
Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder was buried in the unfinished mosque which he had financed after the mass funeral procession escorting an ambulance carrying Hariri's coffin covered with national flag marched through the main streets to the mosque in the capital Beirut.
